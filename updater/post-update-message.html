</p>

<p>
    <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are just some of the <b>NEW</b> features that were added in this update:</u>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Exit Startup temperature (suggested by @EPGrillz), allows you to set a temperature/threshold where the grill will exit 
        startup and go into the next mode.  This can be configured in settings.  If the grill starts hot and has already exceeded 
        this temperature, then the grill will continue with startup for the normal amount of time.  
    </li>
    <li>
        ILI9341 display menu and encoder improvements (submitted by @dogtreatfairy). Improves the display menu readability, adds 
        back button and improves the encoder responsiveness. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Default, Basic dashboards and Control Panel now have the ability to take keyboard input for hold and notification values.  Just click 
        value and change it using the keyboard.  The sliders will still work as normal if you prefer this.    
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a warning to the Configuration Wizard, when the system is running/active so that you don't have to wait until the very end 
        of the configuration to realize that you cannot submit changes.  (feature suggested by Discord user @Richie)
    </li>
    <li>
        Added default values to PID Settings Page
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved visibility of save buttons on the settings page. (Suggested by @chrisusernamechanged)
    </li>
    <li>
        Behind the scenes improvements including:  Replace 'is_raspberry_pi' with 'is_real_hardware' functions planning for future
        platform support.  Add require_reboot flag to Wizard items (Added to PWM / DSI Touch Display devices) if a reboot is required
        when changing this configuration.  Add general commands list to Wizard items (Added to PWM board so no manual edits are required). 
        Added configuration for dashboards that allow extending/saving features for different dashboards.  Updated the ChartJS version to v3.9.1.
        Added common deep dictionary update function that allows dictionaries to be updated in a recursive way simplifying the logic of updating
        dictionaries. Adding system level capabilities so that future functionality can be added (i.e. wifi signal strength, undervolt detection)
    </li>
</ul>
