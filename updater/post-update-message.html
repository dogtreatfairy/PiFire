                This release contains bug fixes and feature updates since the previous version.

                 <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are just some of the <b>NEW</b> features that were added in this update:</u>
             </p>
             
             <ul>
                 <li>
                     Added experimental DSI based touch display, allowing for touch input from a DSI based display on the Raspberry Pi.  
                     As of now, this is an experimental addition and should be expected to have bugs.  Performance is also a concern, as 
                     this module utilizes PyGame for displaying graphics and getting input from the touch display.  This will be fairly 
                     laggy on a Pi Zero 2W (or Pi 3 A+).   
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Exit Startup temperature (suggested by @EPGrillz), allows you to set a temperature/threshold where the grill will exit 
                     startup and go into the next mode.  This can be configured in settings.  If the grill starts hot and has already exceeded 
                     this temperature, then the grill will continue with startup for the normal amount of time.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     ILI9341 display menu and encoder improvements (submitted by @dogtreatfairy). Improves the display menu readability, adds 
                     back button and improves the encoder responsiveness. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added ETA feature for any probe with notification set.  This ETA is calculated using an interpolation function (currently linear)
                     which is still very much experimental.  This feature will continue to be worked on and enhanced.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Default and Basic dashboards now have the ability to show/hide cards including the hopper and status cards.  Look for the gear 
                     icon in the corner of the window.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Default, Basic dashboards and Control Panel now have the ability to take keyboard input for hold and notification values.  Just click 
                     value and change it using the keyboard.  The sliders will still work as normal if you prefer this.    
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added a warning to the Configuration Wizard, when the system is running/active so that you don't have to wait until the very end 
                     of the configuration to realize that you cannot submit changes.  (feature suggested by Discord user @Richie)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added support for v2.1.0 Android Application.  Thank you to @weberbox for updating the app to work with the latest PiFire changes!
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Improved visibility of save buttons on the settings page. (Suggested by @chrisusernamechanged)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added support for DS18B20 1-Wire Thermometer, mainly to be used for calibration of other probes as it does not have adequate temperature
                     ranges for actual grill usages. This probe is currently experimental. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Complete overhaul of the tuning tool, including adding an auto-tuner. The tools are now more mobile friendly, meaning you can use your phone
                     to go through the process of tuning your probes.  In addition, the auto-tuner allows you to tune any of your resistance based probes against
                     any other probe in the system (for example utilizing the new DS18B20 probe).  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     New Elapsed Time card on the default dashboard which shows you the total elapsed time since startup.  (suggested by Discord user @bassmanadam) 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added safety feature to require a confirmation when pressing the startup button on the WebUI control panel.  This will help to prevent 
                     false/accidental startup button presses.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     New API capabilities including a much simplified API interface for setting and getting data.  Details in the updated documentation. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added 'Always Prime on Startup' feature which allows the user to have a default prime amount on startup.  Note that if the user selects startup
                     again during priming that was initiated with this feature then priming will be cancelled and the grill will enter startup mode.  (feature initially 
                     suggested by Discord user @TSJ)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Overhauled timer UI on the web interface to utilize the newly created API calls (Eventually may deprecate the /timer function) and improve the UX.  
                     Timers also will automatically detect if they have started from another source and display in the web interface. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Attempted to address the issue on the mobile Web UI where a long Grill Name (on the NAV Bar) would push the navbar menu to the next line.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added wifi link quality to the admin system information. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Added throttling and undervoltage detection which is currently reported via the admin system information. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Behind the scenes improvements including:  
                     <ul>
                         <li>
                             Replace 'is_raspberry_pi' with 'is_real_hardware' functions planning for future platform support.  
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Add require_reboot flag to Wizard items (Added to PWM / DSI Touch Display devices) if a reboot is required
                             when changing this configuration.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Add general commands list to Wizard items (Added to PWM board so no manual edits are required). 
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Added configuration for dashboards that allow extending/saving features for different dashboards.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Updated the ChartJS version to v3.9.1.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Added common deep dictionary update function that allows dictionaries to be updated in a recursive way simplifying the logic of updating
                             dictionaries.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Adding system level capabilities so that future functionality can be added (i.e. wifi signal strength, undervolt detection). 
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Moved Push Bullet and Pushover notifications to utilize the Apprise module (no changes in how they are configured from the webUI).
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Moved most startup and shutdown settings to 'startup' and 'shutdown' respectively in the settings.json file for housekeeping purposes. 
                             Heads up to anyone working on any forks or applications that might rely on these settings. 
                         </li>
                         <li>
                             Added system functions/commands so that specific system commands can be customized per platform (i.e. in the future allow for other SBCs)
                         </li>
                     </ul>
                 </li>
             </ul>
